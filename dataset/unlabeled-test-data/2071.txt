<B>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: </B> With the patient under adequate anesthesia, the upper extremity was prepped and draped in a sterile manner.  The arm was exsanguinated.  The tourniquet was elevated to 290 mm/Hg.  Attention was turned to the palmar surface of the thumb where a transverse incision was made over the A-1 pulley.  Blunt dissection exposed radial and ulnar neurovascular bundles which were retracted out of the operative field.  The A-1 pulley was identified.  The A-1 pulley was divided along its radial border, completely freeing the stenosing tenosynovitis (trigger release).  The skin was allowed to resume its normal anatomical position and was closed with interrupted sutures.  Sterile dressings were then applied to all wounds.  The tourniquet was deflated, and the patient was returned to the Holding Area in satisfactory condition, having tolerated the procedure well.
