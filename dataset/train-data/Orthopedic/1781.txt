<B>PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:</B>  Left little finger extensor tendon laceration.

<B>POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: </B> Left little finger extensor tendon laceration.

<B>PROCEDURE PERFORMED:  </B>Repair of left little extensor tendon.

<B>COMPLICATIONS:</B>  None.

<B>BLOOD LOSS: </B> Minimal.

<B>ANESTHESIA: </B> Bier block.

<B>INDICATIONS: </B> The patient is a 14-year-old right-hand dominant male who cut the back of his left little finger and had a small cut to his extensor tendon.

<B>DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: </B> The patient was taken to the operative room, laid supine, administered intervenous sedation with Bier block and prepped and draped in a sterile fashion.  The old laceration was opened and the extensor tendon was identified and there was a small longitudinal laceration in the tendon, which is essentially in line with the tendon fibers.  This was just proximal to the PIP joint and on complete flexion of the PIP joint, I did separate just a little bit that was not thought to be significantly dynamically unstable.  It was sutured with a single 4-0 Prolene interrupted figure-of-eight suture and on dynamic motion it did not separate at all.  The wound was irrigated and closed with 5-0 nylon interrupted sutures.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the PCU in good condition.
