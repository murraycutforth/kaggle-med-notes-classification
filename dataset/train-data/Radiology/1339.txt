<B>INDICATIONS:</B>     Abnormal EKG.

<B>STRESS TECHNIQUE:</B>   Dobutrex was infused at 10 &micro;g/kg/minute increasing in three-minute intervals.  Maximum heart rate was 113.  No significant EKG changes noted.

<B>NARRATIVE:</B>  Uptake of radioisotope was adequate in all views.  There was an inferior abnormality noted in the short axis view from 4:00-6:30.  In the vertical long axis view, there was an inferior abnormality with minimal improvement.  The horizontal long axis view had a lateral apical abnormality with no change.

<B>WALL MOTION:</B>  The left ventricle was of normal size and motion.  All wall segments moved normally.

<B>EJECTION FRACTION:</B>  72%.

<B>CONCLUSIONS:</B>
1.  Negative Dobutrex stress test.
2.  Normal wall motion and ejection fraction.
3.  Abnormal nuclear scan consistent with possible underlying ischemic heart disease.  Clinical correlation suggested.
