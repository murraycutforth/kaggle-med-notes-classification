<B>EXAM:</B>  Renal ultrasound.

<B>HISTORY: </B> Renal failure, neurogenic bladder, status-post cystectomy.

<B>TECHNIQUE: </B> Multiple ultrasonographic images of the kidneys were obtained in the transverse and longitudinal planes.

<B>COMPARISON:</B>  Most recently obtained mm/dd/yy.

<B>FINDINGS:</B>  The right kidney measures 12 x 5.2 x 4.6 cm and the left kidney measures 12.2 x 6.2 x 4.4 cm.  The imaged portions of the kidneys fail to demonstrate evidence of mass, hydronephrosis or calculus.  There is no evidence of cortical thinning.

Incidentally there is a rounded low-attenuation mass within the inferior aspect of the right lobe of the liver measuring 2.1 x 1.5 x 1.9 cm which has suggestion of some peripheral blood flow.

<B>IMPRESSION:</B>
1.  No evidence of hydronephrosis.
2.  Mass within the right lobe of the liver.  The patient apparently has a severe iodine allergy.  Further evaluation with MRI is recommended.
3.  The results of this examination were given to XXX in Dr. XXX office on mm/dd/yy at XXX
