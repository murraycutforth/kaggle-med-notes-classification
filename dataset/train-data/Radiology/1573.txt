<B>INDICATIONS:</B>  Atrial fibrillation, coronary disease.

<B>STRESS TECHNIQUE:</B> The patient was infused with dobutamine to a maximum heart rate of 142.  ECG exhibits atrial fibrillation.

<B>IMAGE TECHNIQUE:</B>  The patient was injected with 5.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.

<B>IMAGE ANALYSIS:</B>  It should be noted that the images are limited slightly by the patient's obesity with a weight of 263 pounds.  There is normal LV myocardial perfusion.  The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 65%.  There is normal global and regional wall motion.

<B>CONCLUSIONS:</B>
1.  Basic rhythm of atrial fibrillation with no change during dobutamine stress, maximum heart rate of 142.
2.  Normal LV myocardial perfusion.
3.  Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 65%.
4.  Normal global and regional wall motion.
