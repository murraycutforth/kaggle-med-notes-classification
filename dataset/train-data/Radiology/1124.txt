<B>INDICATIONS:  </B>Chest pain.

<B>STRESS TECHNIQUE:</B>   The patient exercised for 5.0 minutes to a heart rate of 133.  ECG was normal.  Patient achieved 7.0 METS.

<B>IMAGE TECHNIQUE:</B>  The patient was injected with 4.2 millicuries of thallous chloride and subsequently imaged on the gated tomographic SPECT system.

<B>IMAGE ANALYSIS:</B>  There is normal LV myocardial perfusion.  The LV systolic ejection fraction is normal at 79%.  There is normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.

<B>CONCLUSIONS:</B>
1.  Normal ECG stress.
2.  Reduced aerobic capacity of 7 METS.
3.  Normal LV myocardial perfusion.
4.  Normal LV systolic ejection fraction of 79%.
5.  Normal global and regional wall motion of the left ventricle.
